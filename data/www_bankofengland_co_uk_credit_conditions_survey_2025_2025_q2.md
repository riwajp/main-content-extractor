Credit Conditions Survey - 2025 Q2
==================================

This quarterly survey of banks and building societies is aimed at improving our understanding of trends and developments in credit conditions.

Published on 03 July 2025

Overview
--------

As part of our mission to maintain monetary and financial stability, we need to understand trends and developments in credit conditions. This quarterly survey of bank and building society lenders is an input to this work. The survey covers:

*   secured and unsecured lending to households; and
*   lending to non-financial corporations, small businesses, and to non-bank financial firms.

This report presents the results of the 2025 Q2 survey. Lenders were asked to report changes in the three months to end-May 2025 (Q2), relative to the period between December and February, and expected changes in the three months to end-August 2025 (Q3), relative to the period between March and May.**The survey was conducted between 27 May and 13 June 2025. Any impact from more recent developments will, therefore, not be captured.**

The results are based on lenders’ own responses to the survey, and are reported as net percentage balances. The changes in balances are described as an ‘increase’ if greater than 10 in absolute terms, as ‘slight’ if between 5 and 10 and as ‘unchanged’ if less than 5. The results do not necessarily reflect our views on credit conditions. You can read a full guide to interpreting the survey and copies of the questionnaires at the end of this page.

You can also read more background information on the survey in the 2007 Q3 Quarterly Bulletin article[The Bank of England Credit Conditions Survey](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2007/q3/the-bank-of-england-credit-conditions-survey).

The 2025 Q3 Credit Conditions Survey will be published on 16 October 2025.

How to interpret this survey
----------------------------

This report presents the results of the 2025 Q2 survey. It was conducted between 27 May and 13 June 2025. The results are based on lenders’ own responses to the survey. They do not necessarily reflect our views on credit conditions. To calculate aggregate results, each lender is assigned a score based on their response. Lenders who report that credit conditions have changed ‘a lot’ are assigned twice the score of those who report that conditions have changed ‘a little’. These scores are then weighted by lenders’ market shares. The results are analysed by calculating ‘net percentage balances’. The net percentage balances are scaled to lie between (+/-)100.

In this report, changes in balances are described as an ‘increase’ if greater than 10 in absolute terms, as ‘slight’ if between 5 and 10 and as ‘unchanged’ if less than 5.

Annexes
-------

*   To calculate aggregate results, each lender is assigned a score based on their response. Lenders who report that credit conditions have changed ‘a lot’ are assigned twice the score of those who report that conditions have changed ‘a little’. These scores are then weighted by lenders’ market shares. The results are analysed by calculating ‘net percentage balances’ – the difference between the weighted balance of lenders reporting that, for example, demand was higher/lower or terms and conditions were tighter/looser. The net percentage balances are scaled to lie between ±100. This annex reports the net percentage balance of respondents for each question in the secured lending questionnaire.
    
    Positive balances indicate that lenders, on balance, reported/expected demand/credit availability/defaults to be higher than over the previous/current three-month period, or that the terms and conditions on which credit was provided became cheaper or looser respectively.
    
    Where the survey balances are discussed, descriptions of an ‘increase’ refer to a net percentage balance greater than 10 in absolute terms, and a ‘slight’ change refers to a net percentage balance of between 5 and 10 in absolute terms. Survey balances between 0 and 5 in absolute terms are described as unchanged. (The 2019 Q2 and earlier reports also described changes greater than 20 in absolute terms as ‘significant’).
    
    The first Credit Conditions Survey was conducted in 2007 Q2 and additional questions have been included since 2007 Q4. A full set of results is available in the Excel file in Related documents.

    *   (a) Net percentage balances are calculated by weighting together the responses of those lenders who answered the question by their market shares. Positive balances indicate that lenders, on balance, reported/expected demand/credit availability/defaults to be higher than over the previous/current three-month period, or that the terms and conditions on which credit was provided became cheaper or looser respectively.
    *   (b) A positive balance indicates that the changes in the factors described have served to increase credit availability.
    
*   The methodology for calculating, and interpretation of the aggregate results are as described in Annex 1. A full set of results is available in the Excel file in Related documents.

    *   (a) Net percentage balances are calculated by weighting together the responses of those lenders who answered the question by their market shares. Positive balances indicate that lenders, on balance, reported/expected demand/credit availability/defaults to be higher than over the previous/current three-month period, or that the terms and conditions on which credit was provided became cheaper or looser respectively.
    *   (b) A positive balance indicates that the changes in the factors described have served to increase credit availability/demand.
    *   (c) A positive balance indicates an improvement in the credit quality of new borrowing.
    *   (d) A positive balance indicates an increase in maximum maturities on new loans. The sign convention was changed in 2009 Q4 and was applied to the back data accordingly.
    
*   The methodology for calculating, and interpretation of the aggregate results are as described in Annex 1. A full set of results is available in the Excel file in Related documents.

    #### Footnotes
    
    *   (a) Net percentage balances are calculated by weighting together the responses of those lenders who answered the question by their market shares. Positive balances indicate that lenders, on balance, reported/expected demand/credit availability/defaults to be higher than over the previous/current three-month period, or that the terms and conditions on which credit was provided became cheaper or looser respectively.
    *   (b) A positive balance indicates that the changes in the factors described have served to increase credit availability/demand.
    *   (c) A positive balance indicates an improvement in the credit quality of new borrowing.
    *   (d) A positive balance indicates an increase in new corporate loan tenors. The sign convention was changed in 2009 Q3 and was applied to the back data accordingly.
