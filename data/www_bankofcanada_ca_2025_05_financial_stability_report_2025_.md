A stable and efficient financial system is essential for sustaining economic growth and raising standards of living. In the_Financial Stability Report_, the Bank of Canada assesses the resilience of the Canadian financial system and focuses on key risks that could undermine its stability. Ultimately, financial stability benefits all Canadians.

Bank of Canada analysis and research about the structure and efficiency of the financial system can be found on the[Financial System Hub](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/financial-system/financial-system-hub/).

The_Financial Stability Report_is a product of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada: Tiff Macklem, Carolyn Rogers, Toni Gravelle, Sharon Kozicki, Nicolas Vincent, Rhys Mendes and Michelle Alexopoulos.

Overall assessment
------------------

### Key takeaways

*   Canada’s financial system is resilient. Overall, households, businesses, banks and non-bank financial intermediaries successfully weathered the pandemic, a period of elevated inflation, and sharp increases in interest rates.
*   Over the past 12 months, Canadian households have been carrying, on average, less debt relative to their income, and insolvency filings by businesses have dropped significantly. But there are pockets of financial stress. The economic impacts of the pandemic, as well as elevated housing prices due to persistent imbalances in the housing market, have led to higher levels of debt for some households and businesses. This has made them more vulnerable to financial shocks.
*   Because Canadian households and businesses have remained resilient overall, financial institutions have not come under stress. Canadian banks have generally maintained elevated capital buffers and have increased provisions for credit losses. Liquidity levels have remained high, and access to funding has continued to be strong.
*   Recently, large and abrupt shifts in the direction of US trade policy have led to some bouts of extreme market volatility, including in the normally low-risk market for US Treasuries. This volatility tested the resilience of market participants—particularly non-bank financial intermediaries deploying arbitrage strategies in the US Treasury market.
*   The trade war currently threatens the Canadian economy and poses risks to financial stability. Near-term unpredictability of US trade and economic policy could cause further market volatility and a sharp repricing in assets, leading to strains on liquidity. In extreme circumstances, market volatility could turn into market dysfunction.
*   In the medium to long term, a prolonged global trade war would have severe economic consequences. It would reduce economic growth and increase unemployment. Some households and businesses would be unable to continue making debt payments. If household and business credit defaults were to occur on a large scale, banks could see greater losses than they have provisioned for. This could lead them to pull back on lending, potentially exacerbating economic and financial stress.
*   The Bank of Canada is watching developments closely and remains in regular contact with financial system participants and with other financial authorities in Canada and globally. A stable and resilient financial system—one that absorbs shocks and does not amplify them—can help the economy through periods of turbulence.

### The financial system began 2025 with increased resilience

From the time of the 2024 Report until the beginning of 2025, major central banks eased monetary policy as inflation fell worldwide. Lower policy interest rates helped reduce vulnerabilities in the financial system related to debt serviceability.

Despite brief periods of volatility in global markets, Canadian fixed-income and other core funding markets functioned well, and debt issuance conditions remained solid. Banks maintained elevated levels of capital and liquid assets. Non-financial businesses also kept healthy balance sheets. As interest rates declined, the pressure on businesses and households with variable-rate debt and those facing mortgage renewals also eased.

At the same time, some risks increased. Financial asset prices rose, and valuations in some markets appeared elevated. Global debt levels also increased. Leverage of some non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) continued to grow alongside a rise in their participation in core funding markets.

### The trade war and pervasive uncertainty have rattled markets

Since January, the unpredictability of US trade policy has caused a sharp increase in uncertainty and market volatility. The new tariffs announced by the United States in early April were significantly larger than market participants had anticipated. This led to sharp repricing in equity, bond and currency markets as investors revised their economic outlooks. Benchmark equity indexes fell sharply before recovering almost entirely, while stock market volatility rose to its highest level since the COVID-19 crisis. Sovereign bond yields in Canada and the United States saw large swings. Many investors appeared to diversify away from US assets. The US dollar and US Treasuries weakened in tandem with stocks instead of playing their traditional safe-haven roles amid uncertainty. Part of that weakening may reflect an unwinding of leveraged positions by hedge funds and other market participants.

Even as volatility spiked and liquidity at times diminished in some asset classes, markets continued to function relatively well both globally and in Canada. But market participants in Canada have been cautious. Some have pre-emptively adjusted their portfolios or investment strategies, reduced the amount of risk they take on or sought additional protection against losses. Many are also reviewing whether their hedging strategies need to be adjusted to reflect recent market conditions.

The trade war and ensuing uncertainty have reshaped the global backdrop, lowering the prospects for global growth and raising inflation expectations.

### Vulnerable households and businesses may struggle with debt, causing credit losses

In Canada, uncertainty about the scope and duration of the trade war has weighed on consumer and business sentiment and decisions.

To assess how a trade war could affect the Canadian economic outlook, the Bank’s April 2025[_Monetary Policy Report_](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/publications/mpr/mpr-2025-04-16/)(MPR) presented two illustrative scenarios spanning a wide range of paths for US trade policy. In Scenario 1, most new tariffs get negotiated away and their impact is limited, although uncertainty remains. In Scenario 2, a long-lasting global trade war with large and permanent tariffs brings severe economic consequences for Canada, including a year-long recession. These are two of many possible outcomes and, importantly, they are not forecasts.

At the same time, the MPR acknowledged the presence of further downside risks to these scenarios from potential worsening of financial stress. Permanent tariffs could cause high unemployment and business insolvencies that result in defaults on household and business debt. This would lead to credit losses for banks and would test the financial system’s resilience.

Canadian banks have maintained healthy balance sheets, putting them in a good position to absorb higher credit losses ([Box 1](#box1)). Nevertheless, credit losses could lead banks to reduce lending. This could exacerbate an economic downturn.

### The trade war increases the risk of disorderly market sell-offs

Continued US trade policy uncertainty could spur further market volatility and an abrupt repricing of assets, which in turn could lead to acute and persistent liquidity pressures that test the financial system’s resilience.[1](#footnote-1 "Asked what could trigger a severe repricing in markets, respondents to the Bank’s 2025 Financial System Survey mentioned a trade war most often, followed by geopolitical tensions.")

A further correction in asset prices could be amplified if leveraged investors were to quickly unwind their trading positions. Asset managers might hoard cash and sell fixed-income assets to meet fund redemptions or margin calls. Liquidity in core funding markets could deteriorate if volatility caused hedge funds to step away from these markets or to quickly reduce leverage. This risk is exacerbated by the increasingly large presence of hedge funds in sovereign bond markets, including in the Government of Canada securities and repurchase (repo) markets.

Banks could also cut back on their intermediation services to protect their balance sheets—further disrupting the supply of liquidity when market participants need it most.

For a detailed assessment of the potential impacts of a trade war, see[In focus—How a severe and long-lasting global trade war could affect financial stability](#if1).

### The Bank will closely monitor a range of risks to financial stability

As the trade war unfolds, the Bank will be closely watching the risks around debt serviceability and market functioning. The main near-term concern is the risk of a disorderly market sell-off. Over time, the risks to household and business income, and by extension to banks, could grow if the economic impacts of the trade war were to increase. Interconnections in the financial system could amplify the impacts if risks were to materialize ([Box 2](#box2)).

As the policies of the US administration disrupt global trade, they could also reshape the international financial and monetary system. There are signs that investors have been rebalancing some of their exposure away from US assets toward other markets. At this stage, it is not clear whether this is a short-lived adjustment or a process that will build and gain momentum over time. Such adjustments could lead to sharp increases in the risk premium that investors require to hold US assets. Drastic shifts in global financial flows have the potential to disrupt liquidity in core funding markets and cause stress across the global financial system.

In the current context, the Bank will closely monitor:

*   **Indicators****of financial stress**—such as delinquency rates for businesses and households, especially for consumer credit products
*   **Evidence of precautionary behaviour by financial system participants**—such as borrowers drawing on lines of credit more than usual, many investors abruptly moving away from risky assets and leveraged positions, or banks building additional capacity to absorb losses
*   **Availability of credit**—including the extent to which households and businesses can refinance existing borrowing or fund new credit, particularly for workers and firms in sectors heavily exposed to tariffs
*   **Conditions for funding and market liquidity**—especially evidence of rapid or persistent deterioration in core funding markets such as government bond and repo markets

The Bank will continue to work closely with federal and provincial financial authorities to monitor and assess the health of Canada’s financial system and to address potential emerging issues. The objective is to foster a stable and resilient financial system that absorbs shocks and can support the economy through periods of turbulence.

Households
----------

Many households continue to adjust to the higher debt-servicing costs that were a key concern in the previous Report. Mortgage holders have proved resilient in the face of higher payments. Signs of financial stress have increased over the past 12 months but remain concentrated among households without a mortgage.

While interest rates have come down significantly over the past year, previous increases in interest rates are still affecting mortgage renewals. A large share of mortgages being renewed this year or next were taken out during the pandemic at historically low interest rates. Despite rates being much lower than they were 12 months ago, most of these households will still see payment increases when they renew.

In past Reports, the Bank has regularly highlighted the vulnerability in the financial system created by high household indebtedness. While indebtedness remains elevated, it has come down over the past 12 months—the ratio of household debt to disposable income has declined from 179% to 173%. With interest rates lower now than a year ago, the Bank is less concerned than it was about the impact of high borrowing costs on debt serviceability.

However, the trade war is threatening jobs and incomes, particularly in trade-dependent industries. Some affected households may become unable to continue making debt payments. In turn, this could lead to credit losses at banks (see[In focus—How a severe and long-lasting global trade war could affect financial stability](#if1)).

### Signs of financial stress remain concentrated among households without a mortgage

Since the previous Report, rates of arrears on credit cards and auto loans have risen further for households without a mortgage ([Chart 1](#chart1)). After falling to historically low levels during the pandemic, these arrears rates are now back above their historical levels.

For households with a mortgage, rates of arrears on consumer credit products have also risen over the past 12 months but remain below historical averages.

### Lower interest rates are easing the pressure on mortgage holders

About 60% of all outstanding mortgages in Canada will renew in 2025 or 2026. Based on current market expectations for interest rates, approximately 60% of mortgages in this group will see an increase in their payments at renewal. Most of the mortgages expected to see an increase in payments at renewal are five-year fixed-rate mortgages that were originated or renewed during the pandemic at record-low interest rates. However, given the sharp decline in interest rates over the past year, the average expected increase will be smaller than what market expectations for interest rates a year ago suggested ([Chart 2).](#chart2)

### Most mortgage holders are well positioned to manage higher payments

Mortgages that originated during the pandemic had to qualify under a mortgage stress test to show that borrowers could handle payments under higher interest rates.[2](#footnote-2 "For a discussion of mortgage stress tests and their impact on household resilience, see J. Hartley and N. Paixão, “Mortgage stress tests and household financial resilience under monetary policy tightening,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2024-25 (November 2024).")Based on current market expectations, more than 90% of mortgage holders with a five-year fixed-rate mortgage will face payment increases at renewal that are smaller than they were stress-tested for. This implies their budgets should already have room to accommodate higher mortgage payments.

In addition, most households renewing their mortgage will have seen their income grow, and many have enough financial assets to fund higher payments for at least a year.[3](#footnote-3 "For example, Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey shows the average weekly wage rate of paid employees in Canada grew 24.8% between 2019 and 2024."),[4](#footnote-4 "Analysis using data from the Canadian Financial Monitor suggests that 85% of mortgage holders renewing in 2025 and 2026 could cover their expected payment increases for 12 months or more using current financial assets.")Most homeowners have also seen their home equity boosted by increases in house prices. At the same time, the use of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) has been declining, implying additional capacity to borrow against home equity, if needed.[5](#footnote-5 "The average loan-to-value ratio for homeowners has declined from 74% at the end of 2019 to 71% at the end of 2024. Similarly, the average utilization rate of HELOCs has dropped from 35% at the end of 2019 to 28% at the end of 2024.")Higher levels of equity provide a buffer for mortgage holders who are renewing and choose to refinance to manage their payments.

Taken together, these factors suggest that most households will be able to absorb higher payments as their mortgages renew. But this does not mean it will be easy. Many households will have to adjust their spending to manage higher payments. And some may have trouble keeping up with payments on other debt.

Moreover, the trade war poses risks to employment and income, particularly in industries that depend on trade. Some affected households may find it difficult to manage their debt payments.

Non-financial businesses
------------------------

Non-financial businesses adjusted well to past interest-rate increases and have generally remained in solid financial health over the past 12 months. Larger firms have been supported by their diversified sources of funding and by the fact that most have long-term financing in place. Last year’s surge in insolvency filings by small businesses proved temporary, as anticipated.

The trade war will test the financial resilience of businesses in industries tied to trade. Those with existing vulnerabilities—high leverage, weak profitability and low cash reserves—are at risk of falling behind on debt payments, which could lead to losses for both banks and investors (see[In focus—How a severe and long-lasting global trade war could affect financial stability](#if1)).

### Non-financial businesses remain in good financial health

Among non-financial businesses, the ratio of total debt to assets has remained broadly stable since mid-2023 at relatively low levels ([Chart 3](#chart3)). The liquidity position of these businesses—measured by the ratio of total cash to debt—has deteriorated over the past 12 months but remains robust by historical standards.

Large businesses have generally avoided the immediate impacts of past increases in interest rates because they tend to use long-term sources of financing. About half of the outstanding debt of publicly listed Canadian businesses will not mature until at least 2030. Until the sharp increase in market volatility in early April, the issuance of new debt was strong, and the cost of financing remained low. Since then, issuance has diminished, and spreads between Canadian corporate and government bond yields have widened, returning close to historical averages.

### The surge in small-business insolvencies last year proved temporary

Business insolvencies started to pick up in late 2023 ([Chart 4](#chart4)). The Bank’s analysis in the 2024 Report suggested that the surge would likely be temporary—the result of a delay in insolvency filings from mostly small businesses after pandemic-era government support programs ended.[6](#footnote-6 "Insolvency data reveal that the median liabilities held by businesses at the time of filing were close to $210,000 in 2023. Note that summary statistics calculated using the publicly available dataset from the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy must be interpreted with some caution. This is because data on liabilities reflect what is reported as part of the filing by insolvency trustees, which need to report only $1,000 in liabilities to start the insolvency process. Since 2013, submissions that reported the minimum liabilities represented under 4% of all business insolvency filings. Also, data on liabilities are totalled by the first three digits of postal codes in the dataset.")Business insolvencies have dropped significantly over the past 12 months, which largely aligns with the Bank’s previous analysis.

To date, credit data do not suggest that firms have been drawing pre-emptively on their credit lines to increase their cash balances. However, there has been a slowdown in business loan growth because firms have postponed or cancelled investments given the elevated uncertainty they currently face.

Banks
-----

Canadian banks remain well positioned to support the financial system and the broader economy, even through a period of financial stress. They have good access to funding through deposits and wholesale markets, and credit performance has been strong. They have increased their accumulated provisions—funds set aside for anticipated loan losses—and they maintain elevated levels of capital to absorb unexpected losses. They also continue to hold sufficient liquidity to meet their short-term obligations.

Prolonged and heightened financial stress on households and businesses would eventually spread to banks through higher credit losses. Banks could pull back on lending if losses affected their earnings and, at the extreme, their level of capital. That would add further stress on the economy and challenge overall financial stability (see[In focus—How a severe and long-lasting global trade war could affect financial stability](#if1)).

### Canadian banks maintain good access to funding

Banks have two main sources of funding: customer deposits and funds borrowed through wholesale capital markets. Both have remained readily available over the past 12 months.

Bank deposits have continued to grow. Deposits at large banks grew 10% from March 2024 to March 2025. Yet the composition of bank deposits has shifted. In 2022 and 2023, when interest rates were elevated, households and businesses tended to prefer term deposits over demand deposits. The higher interest rates also increased competition for deposits. As interest rates have come down, deposit growth has been gradually shifting away from term deposits and back to demand deposits.

Investor appetite for bank debt remained strong in 2024 and the first quarter of 2025; as a result, access to funding has been steady, and credit spreads for bank debt issued in wholesale markets have remained narrow ([Chart 5](#chart5)).

### Credit performance remains strong

Among large banks, impairments on loans to households—including mortgages and consumer loans—are low by historical standards, despite a recent upturn ([Chart 6](#chart6)). Impairments on business loans have picked up since the end of 2022 but are still modest relative to historical values.

Compared with their larger counterparts, medium-sized banks have seen a bigger increase in loan impairments, including on business and mortgage loans. This largely reflects their different business models, which can be centred around mortgage lending to higher-risk borrowers and business lending concentrated in specific industries or regions. Medium-sized banks account for only a small fraction of total lending by Canadian banks. For example, the total loan portfolio of medium-sized banks is only about $150 billion, compared with more than $4.3 trillion at large banks.

### Banks are well positioned to cope with a period of stress

Banks’ balance sheets remain robust. If banks start to face financial pressure due to the economic effects of the trade war, they have ways to manage that pressure.

Their first line of defence against rising loan impairments is their accumulated provisions. At large banks, this amount is 8% higher than it was one year ago and 26% higher than two years ago. For medium-sized banks, accumulated provisions are 21% higher than one year ago and about 38% higher than two years ago.

In the event of large credit losses that go beyond what they anticipate and provision for, banks rely on capital to absorb losses. Large banks have increased their capital levels in recent years; their common equity Tier 1 capital ratio averaged 13.3% in the first quarter of 2025, about 2 percentage points higher than in the fourth quarter of 2019.[7](#footnote-7 "The common equity Tier 1 ratio is the highest quality of regulatory capital because it absorbs losses immediately when they occur. In this ratio, the numerator includes the sum of common shares and stock surplus, retained earnings, other comprehensive income, qualifying minority interest and regulatory adjustments. The denominator is risk-weighted assets.")This rise is partly due to past tightening of regulatory requirements.[8](#footnote-8 "For example, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions raised the domestic stability buffer in 2022 and 2023 and has since maintained it at 3.5%, which is near the top of the range of 0% to 4%.")

Stress-testing exercises also show that the capital ratios of large banks would remain well above regulatory minimums, even during a period of severe stress (see[Box 1](#box1)).

Banks are also required to hold adequate levels of liquidity to meet their financial obligations, including through periods of stress such as high levels of deposit outflows or challenges accessing wholesale funding in a timely manner. Large banks continue to have sufficient liquid assets on hand to manage these risks. The average liquidity coverage ratio of large banks was 133% in the fourth quarter of 2024, higher than the regulatory minimum.[9](#footnote-9 "The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is defined as the stock of high-quality liquid assets that enables a bank to survive a 30-day stress scenario. The standard requires that the LCR be no lower than 100% in normal conditions.")Medium-sized banks also carry elevated levels of liquid assets, with an average liquidity coverage ratio over 200%.
