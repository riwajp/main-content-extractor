Results of the second-quarter 2025 survey | Vol. 22.2 | July 21, 2025

The Business Outlook Survey was conducted by in-person, video and phone interviews from May 8 to 28, 2025. The Business Leaders’ Pulse is conducted online every month; the latest results are from April, May and June 2025. This quarter’s publication also includes results from Governing Council outreach as well as special consultations with businesses and industry organizations in trade-sensitive sectors.

Overview
--------

*   Tariffs and related uncertainty, along with spillover effects on the Canadian and global economies, continue to have major impacts on businesses’ outlooks. However, the worst-case scenarios that firms envisioned last quarter are now seen as less likely to occur.
*   Sales outlooks remain pessimistic overall due to widespread concerns about the broader effects of a slowing economy. But recent monthly survey results suggest some improvement in firms’ outlooks—particularly among exporters—because few have been directly affected by the current tariffs.
*   Uncertainty continues to drive cautiousness in outlooks for hiring and investment. Most firms expect to maintain current staffing levels and limit investment to regular maintenance over the next 12 months.
*   For some, cost increases due to tariffs and trade uncertainty have materialized. Affected firms see weak demand and competition as constraining their ability to pass cost increases on to their customers, although most still plan for some pass-through.
*   Businesses’ expectations for short-term inflation have returned to levels reported at the end of 2024.

Tariff impacts have materialized, but expectations for future impacts have eased
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tariffs and trade tensions continue to weigh on the outlooks of many firms. In some cases, the negative effects on costs and sales that most businesses predicted last quarter have materialized, and firms expect them to persist.

At the same time, firms have moderated their expectations for negative impacts, as the worst-case trade scenarios they anticipated last quarter now appear less likely ([Chart 1](#chart1)). For example, around two-thirds of firms expected higher tariff-related costs last quarter compared with only one-third this quarter.

### Chart 1: Fewer firms than last quarter expect adverse impacts from tariffs

Last quarter, firms described the economic environment as highly unpredictable, which made it difficult for them to form a clear outlook for the year ahead. This quarter, more firms can now form an outlook with greater confidence, although they still report that it is hard or somewhat hard to do so. Fewer businesses are considering extremely negative scenarios in their planning.

Nevertheless, uncertainty around financial, economic and political conditions remains the top concern for firms. While worries about tariffs directly affecting Canadian businesses have eased slightly, new concerns have emerged about the broader impacts of tariffs on the global economy and on demand in Canada. Uncertainty is still causing firms to hold off on new investment plans and to conservatively manage their finances, among other actions ([Box 1](#box1)).

Business sentiment, although still subdued, has improved from the sharp declines recorded in March and April 2025 ([Chart 2](#chart2)). Both the previous declines and the recent rebound were seen across exporters and non-exporters, though sentiment among exporters in particular fell sharply during the earlier stage of the trade conflict. Similarly, the share of firms planning for a recession in Canada has declined slightly—from 32% to 28%—but remains above 2024 levels, reflecting ongoing concerns about trade tensions.

### Chart 2: Business sentiment has improved from recent lows

Weak demand is broad-based
--------------------------

Firms’ near-term sales expectations weakened in the second quarter of 2025. The balance of opinion on indicators of future sales has turned negative as tariff-related impacts have materialized. More firms reported their indicators (e.g., order books, advance bookings and sales inquiries) have deteriorated compared with 12 months ago than those that reported their indicators have improved ([Chart 3](#chart3)). This weakness is largely driven by broad spillover effects from the trade conflict, such as:

*   weak spending on services and capital goods by business customers
*   low consumer spending or concerns that consumers could start to spend less
*   weak outlooks in the housing sector
*   soft sales outlooks among oil and gas firms because of downward pressure on global oil prices

For exporters, weakness in near-term sales indicators partly reflects the pull-forward of exports earlier in the year before tariffs were imposed, which was followed by a slowdown because clients had already stocked up on goods.

### Chart 3: Firms’ indicators of future sales are weak

Despite this, the direct impacts tariffs are having on firms’ outlooks are less severe than in the first quarter. Outlooks have improved among businesses strongly affected by trade tensions because the tariffs that have materialized so far are less broad-based than those feared earlier in the year. Most exporters in the Bank of Canada’s business surveys reported not currently being subject to tariffs. This is reflected in improved expectations for export sales growth ([Chart 4](#chart4)). However, in special consultations with Bank staff, exporters currently facing sectoral US tariffs—including manufacturers of steel and aluminum products and firms in the auto sector—continued to report weak outlooks.

### Chart 4: Outlooks for export sales have improved

Plans to expand capacity are still on hold
------------------------------------------

Most firms reported that both their physical capacity and workforce size are sufficient. The share of firms that would have difficulty meeting an unexpected increase in demand remains below its historical average ([Chart 5](#chart5), yellow line). There is little evidence that firms are facing supply chain difficulties restricting their ability to meet demand or that they are experiencing difficulties sourcing critical inputs. Businesses said they can find workers more easily now than at the same time last year, and the share of firms that reported having labour shortages remains below average ([Chart 5](#chart5), green line).

### Chart 5: Most firms have sufficient capacity

Firms’ investment intentions remain muted this quarter, with the balance of opinion well below its long-term average. Many businesses are scaling back their investment plans or putting new investments on hold because of:

*   soft demand
*   ongoing uncertainty
*   sufficient existing capacity

More firms than usual are focusing their investments on routine maintenance rather than expanding capacity or improving productivity ([Chart 6](#chart6)). Yet fewer firms than last quarter expect tariffs and trade tensions to negatively affect their investment plans. This is particularly true for those in the trade-exposed and capital-intensive manufacturing sector.

### Chart 6: Investment plans are focused on maintaining existing capital

Similarly, hiring intentions remain subdued. Fewer firms than usual plan to increase their labour force over the next year ([Chart 7](#chart7)). The shares of firms that are hiring to meet expected sales increases, filling vacant positions, or holding on to excess labour are all below average. However, fewer firms than last quarter expect tariffs to weigh on their hiring plans. Likewise, for consumers in the Bank’s[Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/07/canadian-survey-of-consumer-expectations-second-quarter-of-2025/#bos-link)who work in trade-sensitive sectors, job concerns remain elevated but have diminished from last quarter.

When asked about layoffs, many firms said they would conduct layoffs only if they experienced a sharp or prolonged decline in sales. Even then, layoffs were often viewed as a last resort. Indeed, the share of firms expecting to reduce headcount over the coming year remains largely unchanged and near its historical average.

### Chart 7: The majority of firms plan to keep employment steady

Firms’ expectations for wage growth over the coming year continue to trend lower ([Chart 8](#chart8)). Past disinflation and weak demand are putting downward pressure on businesses’ wage expectations. The average expected wage increase among firms in the Business Outlook Survey is now near its pre-pandemic average. The share of firms planning larger-than-normal wage increases has continued to trend down, with most firms having now returned to what they consider normal wage increases.

Cost pressures from trade tensions remain
-----------------------------------------

Cost pressures continue to be widespread. Roughly half of firms reported already facing additional tariff-related costs. Beyond the direct impact of tariffs on input prices, firms also reported facing additional costs related to finding alternative suppliers and developing new markets.

In this context, tariffs and trade tensions are still the primary source of upward pressure on expected growth in input prices. Firms now expect their input price growth to accelerate over the next 12 months, a contrast from much of the past three years ([Chart 9](#chart9)). These pressures, however, remain moderate—many firms expect only slight, rather than substantial, increases in their input prices.

### Chart 9: Due to tariffs, firms now expect input price growth to accelerate

Tariff-related cost increases are also putting upward pressure on firms’ expected selling prices. But competitive pressures and the current weakness in demand are limiting firms’ ability to pass on these costs to customers. As a result, many businesses expect their selling prices to increase over the coming year at a similar rate as they did over the past year ([Chart 10](#chart10)). Because customers are sensitive to price increases, many firms are absorbing a portion of these increased costs, compressing their profit margins in an effort to preserve market share ([Chart 11](#chart11)).

Near-term inflation expectations have come back down to late-2024 levels after rising sharply last quarter ([Chart 12](#chart12)). Like last quarter, tariffs are the primary driver of inflation expectations. But firms report that direct upward price pressures from tariffs are being partially offset by indirect tariff impacts—namely, slower demand creating disinflationary pressures. Inflation expectations for longer horizons, meanwhile, have edged slightly higher but remain within the Bank’s target range.
