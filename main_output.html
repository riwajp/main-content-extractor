            >Manufacturing activity returned to growth in early 2025, while
            services activity slowed, marking a reversal of the previous trends
            in the two sectors.</strong
          >Hard data on production show that manufacturing activity contracted
          significantly in 2023 and 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, however,
          manufacturing rebounded as the contraction in the euro area excluding
          Ireland came to an abrupt halt, while the expansion in Ireland
          accelerated (Chart A). By contrast, services activity, which had
          continued to expand in the previous two years, lost momentum. Survey
          data on business perceptions from the European Commission corroborate
          this reversal. Manufacturing firms indicated a marked rise in
          perceived activity, which, however, remained below its long-term
          average. Conversely, services firms reported a fall in perceived
          activity below its historical norm. The earlier divergence between
          manufacturing and services reflected the energy-induced inflation
          surge and the ensuing monetary policy tightening, which weighed
          particularly on manufacturing, while services were supported by the
          post-pandemic normalisation of consumption patterns.<sup

          >While some of these drivers have reversed, new factors have emerged.
          Temporary frontloading ahead of higher US tariffs likely supported the
          manufacturing rebound, while rising uncertainty surrounding trade
          policy (and, more broadly, economic policy) appears to have dampened
          overall activity. This box examines frontloading and trade policy
          uncertainty through the lens of granular sectoral data and discusses
          the short-term outlook for manufacturing and services activity.

            boost to manufacturing activity in the first quarter of
            2025.</strong
          >According to corporate surveys, frontloading reflected a temporary
          surge in US demand for euro area goods ahead of the tariff increases
          scheduled for April (Melemenidis et al., 2025). This is consistent
          with the timing and magnitude of the fluctuations in manufacturing
          output. Manufacturing output rose sharply in the first quarter after
          two years of decline, largely driven by a strong increase in March –
          when it peaked, before falling between April and June. Temporary
          frontloading effects are also evident when comparing the exposure of
          different sectors to exports to the United States with their output
          dynamics (Chart B). Output in sectors with higher US export exposure
          recorded a stronger increase in March (Chart B, panel a) and a sharper
          decline between April and June (Chart B, panel b). The pharmaceutical
          industry illustrates these dynamics most clearly, given its high US
          export exposure. Production in this sector rose by nearly 9% in March
          compared with February, then fell by a similar amount on average in
          the second quarter. Across countries, these developments largely
          reflected the high volatility of pharmaceutical output in Germany, the
          Netherlands and, most likely, Ireland.<sup

            >While manufacturing activity was temporarily supported by
            frontloading, rising trade policy uncertainty has likely contributed
            to the recent loss of momentum in services.</strong
          >Following the US Administration’s tariff announcement on 2 April,
          trade policy uncertainty surged to a historic high, well above the
          levels observed during previous episodes of trade tensions, such as
          the US-China disputes in President Trump’s first term (Chart C).<sup
            >[<a href="#footnote.3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup
          >Empirical evidence shows that trade policy uncertainty
          disproportionately weighs on business investment (Caldara et al.,
          2020; Andersson et al., 2024) and on related sectoral activity (De
          Santis and Zimic, 2019). Granular and timely survey data across
          sectors support this finding. During the first Trump Administration,
          perceived activity declined among manufacturing and business services
          firms – both closely tied to business investment – while remaining
          resilient among consumer services firms (Chart C, panel a).<sup
            >[<a href="#footnote.4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup
          >Similarly, at the current juncture, heightened trade policy
          uncertainty has likely weighed more on manufacturing and business
          services than on consumer services. In the case of manufacturing,
          however, this negative impact has so far been amply offset by positive
          frontloading effects, which have temporarily boosted output (Chart C,
          panel b).

          <strong class="intense-emphasis"
            >Several factors are driving the outlook for manufacturing and
            services, with no clear signal yet as to which will prevail.</strong
          >European Commission survey data indicate that activity has fallen
          somewhat in consumer services, while recovering slightly in business
          services, in the third quarter to date, as trade policy uncertainty
          has abated (Chart C, panel b). Moreover, manufacturing activity has
          risen further above its level at the start of the year. Looking at
          risks from uncertainty, if trade policy uncertainty were to remain
          elevated by historical standards, its dampening effects could continue
          to weigh on services and become visible in manufacturing as
          frontloading unwinds. However, the trade agreement between the EU and
          the United States could trigger a fast decline in such uncertainty,
          mitigating some of its adverse effects. In addition to
          uncertainty-related risks, other factors are likely to shape the
          outlook. Headwinds stem from the appreciation of the euro and the
          impact of higher tariffs, while delayed effects from monetary policy
          loosening and possible support from increased spending on defence and
          infrastructure provide countervailing tailwinds.

              Pharmaceutical output in Germany and the Netherlands rose by about
              19% and 17% between February and March and declined by about 15%
              and 26% on average in the second quarter compared with March,
              respectively. While no official production data are available for
              the Irish pharmaceutical industry, Irish output in the “modern
              sector” (including pharmaceuticals) as well as exports of
              pharmaceutical products to the United States increased sharply in
              March before declining in the second quarter, which may suggest a
              similar output profile.

              Trade policy uncertainty in this box refers to the index developed
              by Caldara et al. (2020), which is constructed by counting the
              frequency of joint occurrences of trade policy and uncertainty
              terms in major US newspapers. For an early assessment of the
              importance of trade policy uncertainty compared with other
              uncertainty measures during the first Trump Administration, see
              Azqueta-Gavaldón et al. (2019).

              The increasing trade policy uncertainty during President Trump’s
              first term should be only one factor behind the decline in
              perceived activity in manufacturing and business services. This
              development may also have been influenced by other factors,
              including difficulties in the automotive industry owing to the
              introduction of new emissions standards, financial turmoil in
              emerging markets and Brexit (Gunnella and Quaglietti, 2019).
