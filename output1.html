					<p>‘Money shapes economies, economies shape nations, nations shape history.’ This quip from Larry
						Summers, though pithy, contains a kernel of truth. It is equally true that through history, bursts of
						technological innovation have intersected with changing needs of the economy to generate profound
						implications for society. Look no further than the introduction of paper money to replace copper coin in
						China’s Song dynasty, the development of double-entry ledgers in Renaissance Europe, the laying of
						the transatlantic cables in the 1850s and the dematerialisation (electronification) of securities half a
						century ago.</p>
					<p>Fast forward to today, rapid innovation in technology and structural change in the financial economy is
						again raising important questions about whether our monetary arrangements are fit for purpose –
						this time in the digital age.</p>
					<p>It is great to be here at Intersekt. This is an important forum where industry and members of the policy
						making and academic community can come together to discuss issues that will shape our financial future.
						It is also timely because this morning the RBA and Treasury will publish their first ever joint paper
						– part stock take, part roadmap – on central bank digital currency (CBDC) and the future of
						digital money in Australia. This is the latest initiative to emerge from the RBA’s expanding work
						program on the future of money. I am here this morning to highlight three key messages from this work.
					</p>
					<p>First, and with the strong endorsement of the Payments System Board, I can confirm that the RBA is making
						a strategic commitment to prioritise its work agenda on wholesale digital money and infrastructure
						– including wholesale CBDC – rather than retail CBDC. At the present time, we assess the
						benefits to the economy as more promising, and the challenges less problematic, for a wholesale CBDC
						compared to a retail version. This recognises that unlike a retail CBDC that would be issued for use
						among the public, a wholesale CBDC would represent more an evolution than revolution in our monetary
						arrangements. It also recognises the stabilising role of central bank money in the settlement of
						wholesale market transactions, particularly in markets that are (or could be) systemically important
						– a point emphasized in international standards.</p>
					<p>Second, we are publicly committing to a three-year applied research program on the future of digital money
						in Australia. This has a number of elements. Our most immediate priority is to launch a new project with
						industry on wholesale CBDC and tokenised commercial bank deposits. The focus will be on understanding how
						new ledger arrangements and concepts like ‘programmability’ and ‘atomic settlement’
						in tokenised markets could unlock benefits for the Australian financial system and wider economy. We
						don’t have all the answers here, so look forward to engaging with industry partners who have an
						ability and appetite to innovate with the national interest in mind.</p>
					<p>Third, the view of the RBA and Treasury is that if a public policy case ever emerged in favour of issuing
						a retail CBDC, the Australian Government would be the ultimate decision authority and it would almost
						certainly require legislative change. This would also be in keeping with the recent international
						experience. In the case of wholesale CBDC, the decision making and legislative implications would depend
						on how transformative the new arrangements were. But in either case, you should expect close engagement
						between the RBA, Treasury and Government.</p>
					<h2>(Digital) Money in Australia Today</h2>
					<p>At this point a quick stock take of our current monetary arrangements is in order. There are three forms
						of money in Australia today – physical cash, Exchange Settlement (ES) balances and commercial bank
						deposits (Graph&nbsp;1). The latter two are digital, by which I mean balances exist only on electronic
						ledgers.</p>
					<div class="image-graph">
						<figure>
							<figcaption>
								<div class="title"><span>Graph 1</span></div>
							</figcaption>
							
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>Commercial banks issue deposits that are accessible to the public. ES balances are issued by the RBA to
						eligible financial institutions for monetary policy and financial stability purposes, including to
						facilitate the settlement of payments.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn1" id="r1" aria-label="Go to endnote 1">[1]</a></sup> These arrangements form our ‘two-tier’
						monetary system, which reflects the comparative advantage of the public and private sectors. Central
						banks don’t have a comparative advantage in providing customer-facing services directly to
						households and firms. Rather, they focus on supplying foundational public goods (the ‘base
						tier’), including a safe settlement asset, essential infrastructure and a level playing field for
						competition. This enables private innovation in money and payment services (the ‘top tier’),
						which can lead to more value at reduced cost for households and firms.</p>
					<p>Central bank money is available to the public but takes a physical form (i.e. banknotes), and fewer
						Australians are choosing to transact in it: the share of transactions occurring in cash declined from
						62&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent to 13&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent between 2010 and 2022 (Graph&nbsp;2).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn2" id="r2" aria-label="Go to endnote 2">[2]</a></sup> As
						elsewhere, the Australian public holds virtually all their money in bank deposits.</p>
					<div class="image-graph">

						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>It is reasonable to ask at this point: if, as in many other advanced economies, digital money is already
						so dominant in Australia, then what is the big deal about CBDC?</p>
					<p>At one level, my sense is that much of the attention, if not intrigue, follows from CBDC connecting to
						deeply held views in parts of the community about the rights of citizens and the role and obligations of
						the state. This includes issues of safety, privacy, freedom, sovereignty and even geopolitics –
						issues that put us squarely in political economy territory, which is not exactly the natural habitat of
						most central bankers (!). This might also explain why public debates over retail CBDC have been hotly
						contested in some parts of the world.</p>
					<h2>Retail CBDC Considerations in Australia</h2>
					<p>A retail CBDC that would be available for use among the general public would represent a significant
						change to Australia’s financial arrangements. Our assessment is that the potential benefits of a
						retail CBDC generally appear modest or uncertain at the present time, relative to the challenges it would
						introduce. Most of the arguments made internationally in support of a retail CBDC (set out in bold below)
						reflect issues that are either of limited relevance to Australia, or where it is not obvious that a
						retail CBDC would best address them.</p>
					<p><strong>Offline resilience.</strong> The digitisation of payments and commercial activity has yielded
						significant economic efficiency gains, but also made us vulnerable to disruptions to our digital
						infrastructure (Graph&nbsp;3). Many countries are uplifting their crisis preparedness arrangements in
						response to national security threats and the risk of natural disasters. Social cohesion, not just
						economic disruption, is foremost in mind here.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn3" id="r3" aria-label="Go to endnote 3">[3]</a></sup> However, the processing of payments during electricity
						or telecommunication outages requires an offline capability first and foremost; this needn’t require
						a retail CBDC <cite>per-se</cite>. Though more work is needed, some card payment terminals operated by
						merchants in Australia are already capable of accepting payments offline. Some countries are also
						reconsidering the back-up role that physical cash might play for short-term transactional purposes,
						albeit access to and acceptance of cash still requires supporting offline capabilities.</p>
					<div class="image-graph">
						<figure>
							<figcaption>
								<div class="title"><span>Graph 3</span></div>
							</figcaption>
							
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p><strong>Monetary sovereignty. </strong> If cash usage continues to decline, it has been suggested in some
						jurisdictions that a retail CBDC may be needed to preserve monetary sovereignty.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn4" id="r4" aria-label="Go to endnote 4">[4]</a></sup> Currency
						substitution can certainly compromise the policy objectives of a domestic central bank, where activity
						occurs in a currency and at interest rates outside its control. But the history of currency substitution
						suggests this risk is gravest in economies where institutions and the rule of law are weak, and residents
						and foreign investors have good reason to question the integrity of the domestic currency –
						conditions not apparent in Australia. And while it is possible that a BigTech firm launches another
						global stablecoin initiative in an effort to bundle their digital services with payment services, there
						is now a concerted international effort to closely regulate any such move. Should the United States ever
						issue a retail CBDC, some countries might reconsider their own position given the global role of the
						US&nbsp;dollar. But there is no momentum behind a retail CBDC in American political or policy circles.
						And aside from the legal impediments, I find it inconceivable that a digital Chinese yuan or digital euro
						would circulate as the currency of choice for Australians.</p>
					<p><strong>‘Singleness’ of central bank and private bank money. </strong> A key feature of our
						monetary arrangements is that bank deposits are interchangeable with one another and central bank money,
						on a dollar-for-dollar basis (this is the ‘singleness’ concept). This spares households and
						merchants from wasting resources in repricing the credit risk of different issuers – a lesson
						learned the hard way from the chaotic ‘wildcat’ free-banking era in the United States. It has
						been suggested that if physical cash was no longer available to the public, a retail CBDC may be needed
						to ensure private money retained its value because it would still be interchangeable at par with central
						bank money. However, most central banks have no plans to eradicate physical cash. And central banks
						already support the singleness of money in various ways, including by settling banks’ net payment
						claims ‘at par’ in central bank money.</p>
					<p><strong>Safety. </strong> A retail CBDC would clearly be free of credit and liquidity risk, and would mean
						households still had the choice of transacting in central bank money even in circumstances where cash was
						unavailable or usable (such as online transactions). But the international evidence that households value
						the safety of central bank money is mixed in advanced economies. Cash holdings often increase during
						periods of economic uncertainty, though it is unclear if this owes to the assurance found in the physical
						properties of cash (it can be touched), or to its risk-free status (or both). Survey-based research by
						RBA staff suggests that Australian households would not attach economic value to the risk-less nature of
						a CBDC.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn5" id="r5" aria-label="Go to endnote 5">[5]</a></sup>
						This could reflect the limited experience of Australians with bank failures and/or the range of measures
						to support public confidence in commercial bank deposits, including deposit insurance, depositor
						preference, a robust regime for bank regulation and supervision and the RBA’s role as lender of last
						resort.</p>
					<p><strong>Privacy. </strong> International views on the privacy implications of retail CBDC vary widely
						– some fear a CBDC could be used as a surveillance tool of the state, while others find comfort in
						central banks not having incentives to exploit personal transaction data in the manner of private service
						providers. In any event, few central banks are considering a version of retail CBDC that would be fully
						anonymous given their responsibilities to mitigate financial crime. Research by RBA staff also suggests
						Australian households would attach very limited value to accessing a form of money that makes transaction
						data available to the RBA instead of a commercial bank.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn6" id="r6" aria-label="Go to endnote 6">[6]</a></sup> This suggests privacy considerations should
						not be determinative in any decision on a retail CBDC.</p>
					<p><strong>Efficiency and cost.</strong> Countries without a fast payment system are often most interested in
						retail CBDC. But we are fortunate in Australia to have the New Payments Platform (NPP) that enables
						payments to be processed and settled in near real time on a <span class="no-wrap">24/7</span>/365&nbsp;basis (Graph&nbsp;4). Regulation and competition have also
						lowered digital payment costs in Australia over the past two decades (Graph&nbsp;5).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn7" id="r7" aria-label="Go to endnote 7">[7]</a></sup> That
						said, the extent to which a retail CBDC could further reduce payment costs is yet to be fully assessed
						and would depend on design choices. We are sympathetic to the idea that a retail CBDC could spawn a range
						of new payment services, though this was part of the motivation for last year’s pilot project which
						did not surface compelling retail use cases.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn8" id="r8" aria-label="Go to endnote 8">[8]</a></sup></p>

						</figure>
					</div>
					<p><strong>Financial inclusion. </strong> A final argument sometimes offered in favour of a retail CBDC is
						that it could open up access to financial services. Yet this argument has most relevance in emerging
						market economies – Australian households are already among the most banked societies in the world
						(Graph&nbsp;6). Research by RBA staff has also found that among Australians who continue to rely on
						physical cash, issues like poor internet access and low confidence with digital modes of transacting are
						particularly relevant.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn9" id="r9" aria-label="Go to endnote 9">[9]</a></sup> Further work is therefore needed to understand how a
						retail CBDC could address these issues – at the present time it is not obvious.</p>
					<div class="image-graph">
						<figure>
							<figcaption>
								<div class="title"><span>Graph 6</span></div>
							</figcaption>
							
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>If the potential benefits of a retail CBDC in Australia appear modest or uncertain at present, what about
						the drawbacks? Three stand out: higher borrowing costs, bank runs and challenges with monetary policy
						transmission and implementation.</p>
					<p><strong>Bank funding costs. </strong> Australia has a bank-based financial system. The share of bank
						funding sourced from domestic deposits has risen to around 60&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (Graph&nbsp;7), and is
						higher again for small and regional banks that have limited (if any) access to wholesale markets. Should
						households place their liquid assets in a retail CBDC rather than bank deposits, banks would have to
						offer higher deposit rates and/or tap more volatile and costly sources of funding – costs that
						could be passed on to borrowers. Banks could potentially compete harder for low-cost deposits by
						providing loans only to the very highest quality borrowers, but this would cut off credit access to
						otherwise creditworthy borrowers. And while central banks might consider offsetting a tightening in
						financial conditions with looser monetary policy, the idea that central banks should furnish banks with
						cheap loans as compensation for losing low-cost household deposits is more objectionable – it would
						raise a litany of other issues, moral hazard among them.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn10" id="r10" aria-label="Go to endnote 10">[10]</a></sup></p>
					<div class="image-graph">
						<figure>
							<figcaption>
								<div class="title"><span>Graph 7</span></div>
							</figcaption>
							
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p><strong>Bank runs.</strong> A more significant concern is that a retail CBDC could increase the risk, or
						amplify the effects, of bank runs. In times of stress, access to a risk-free CBDC would increase the
						ability of panicked households to switch out of bank deposits <cite>en masse</cite>. In Australia, most
						bank deposits are held by households and redeemable on demand (Graph&nbsp;8). The events at Silicon
						Valley Bank last year offered a cautionary tale over the risk of rapid-fire bank runs in the digital age
						– one that could be magnified if bank deposits were convertible into CBDC at the touch of a
						smartphone.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn11" id="r11" aria-label="Go to endnote 11">[11]</a></sup></p>
					<div class="image-graph">
						<figure>
							<figcaption>
								<div class="title"><span>Graph 8</span></div>
							</figcaption>
							
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>Under a simplistic hypothetical scenario, RBA staff examined the effects on bank liquidity if Australian
						households simultaneously transferred $5,000&nbsp;from their deposit account into a retail CBDC (assuming
						this was the upper holding limit), where there were no offsetting actions from banks or the central bank.
						Though a purely illustrative exercise, this was shown to reduce banks’ liquidity buffers by <span class="no-wrap">40–60</span>&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, and could put them close to minimum internal
						thresholds (Graph&nbsp;9).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn12" id="r12" aria-label="Go to endnote 12">[12]</a></sup> Central banks have examined measures that could
						forestall or limit the effects of bank runs involving CBDC, including limits on holdings, penalties on
						bank deposit withdrawals and negative interest rates on CBDC in periods of stress. But what such measures
						have in common is an effort to restrict the use of CBDC, which to my mind at least, raises the question
						of whether the benefits of a CBDC would be forfeited in the process.</p>
					<div class="image-graph">
						<figure>
							<figcaption>
								<div class="title"><span>Graph 9</span></div>
							</figcaption>
							
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p><strong>Monetary policy implementation and transmission. </strong> The stock of household deposits is
						large relative to most central bank balance sheets and the markets they operate in. Significant uptake of
						retail CBDC could therefore require a large program of open market operations and have the potential to
						disrupt functioning in key financial markets. Separately, monetary policy transmission could be affected
						by disintermediation of the banking system, given its key role in setting the interest rates that
						influence saving and investment decisions. And while it has been suggested that a retail CBDC could
						enhance policy transmission at the lower bound if it was remunerated at a negative interest rate, this
						would necessitate the phasing out of physical cash – something most economies, Australia included,
						have no plans to do. Indeed, most central banks consider a retail CBDC analogous to a ‘digital
						banknote’ that would complement physical cash, not replace it, meaning it would not bear an interest
						rate.</p>
					<h2>Wholesale CBDC Considerations in Australia</h2>
					<p>Let’s now turn to a wholesale CBDC. The context in which we might consider the case for a wholesale
						CBDC is fundamentally different to retail CBDC because central banks already have a long history of
						issuing digital money to financial institutions in support of their monetary and financial stability
						objectives. In this sense, a wholesale CBDC would be more evolutionary than revolutionary.</p>
					<p>Like ES balances, a wholesale CBDC would be issued to eligible financial institutions and serve as the
						ultimate safe asset in the settlement of wholesale market transactions. What is new is that it could
						exist on different types of ledgers (centralised or decentralised) possibly alongside tokenised assets,
						and offer greater functionality than today’s ES balances. This could support asset settlement and
						other wholesale payments in new ways.</p>
					<p>The larger question here is how could the functioning of existing wholesale markets be enhanced, and new
						ones supported, through innovation in digital money, securities and supporting infrastructure? In some
						respects, innovation in wholesale markets has been less impressive than in retail payments. To cite one
						domestic example, it is striking that price discovery and placement in the $780&nbsp;billion market for
						bank term deposits – comprising around 15&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of bank funding in Australia –
						still largely occurs in branches and over emailed spreadsheets and phone calls in an opaque,
						labour-intensive manner that is little changed from 25&nbsp;years ago. This begs the question – is
						this the best we can do?</p>
					<p>More generally, the Bank for International Settlements and most advanced economy central banks are
						actively exploring opportunities to uplift the functioning of their wholesale markets, including by:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Reducing counterparty and operational risks, and improving capital efficiency, by freeing up
								collateral</strong>: This might be achieved by shrinking the time between trade execution and
							settlement through instantaneous (conditional) ‘atomic settlement’, where money and assets
							exist on the same ledger (or on ledgers that are closely linked). </li>
						<li><strong>Increasing informational transparency and auditability:</strong> Researchers are examining
							how new forms of ledgers and assets could facilitate more transparency, including in greenfield
							markets where the digital representations of assets could be updated and verifiable in real time.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Increasing liquidity and the ability to transact:</strong> This could be supported by
							increased informational efficiency and transparency, <span class="no-wrap">24/7</span>&nbsp;trading
							hours, and the fractionalisation and programmability of assets. </li>
						<li><strong>Reducing intermediary and compliance costs: </strong> Programmability could cut through
							layers of manual processes in the transaction lifecycle, including the automation of compliance
							checks and asset-servicing tasks. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>This exploratory research has seen central banks and industry probe the role that tokenisation might play
						in a future financial system. Digital tokens can take two forms: they can be issued directly or solely
						(as a standalone instrument) on new forms of ledger technology (‘native tokens’), or they can
						digitally represent existing ‘real-world’ money and assets (‘non native tokens’).
						Tokens could be stored, traded and transferred on either centralised or decentralised programmable
						platforms. The programmability of tokens via smart contracts, and the ability to free up collateral and
						reduce counterparty risk by atomically exchanging money and assets on the same ledger, have been of
						particular interest in experimental research.</p>
					<p>When I first spoke about the opportunities and challenges associated with tokenisation in the Australian
						financial system a year ago, I noted the potential benefits were sufficiently interesting to warrant
						further investigation. As a case in point, if tokenisation produced just a small share of the benefits of
						earlier periods of innovation in wholesale markets, then aggregate cost savings to investors and issuers

					<p>For instance, in a world of atomic settlement, orders would likely need to be prefunded, which would
						increase liquidity requirements for market participants as netting benefits would be lost. Liquidity
						conditions could also worsen if trading volumes were fragmented between new platforms and traditional
						infrastructure. New infrastructure is time intensive to establish, so tokenised markets would likely need
						to be interoperable with traditional infrastructure for a considerable period. There is still a way to go
						in resolving governance and legal issues involving smart contracts and tokenised securities. A range of
						non-functional considerations will also need to be better understood, including the impact on central
						bank balance sheets from wholesale CBDC issuance and the trade-offs between transaction processing speed
						and ledger security. An even larger issue (one that could constitute a separate speech) relates to the
						monetary and financial stability implications of widening access arrangements to wholesale central bank
						money.</p>
					<p>It may well be that a significant efficiency uplift in trading, clearing and settlement in our wholesale
						markets can be achieved without the issuance of a wholesale CBDC. But given the Principles for Financial
						Market Infrastructures emphasise the public policy benefits from conducting settlement in central bank
						money, we expect it to continue to have an important anchoring role in any market that is or could be
						systemically important.</p>
					<h2 class="pdf-page-break">A Roadmap</h2>
					<p>Table&nbsp;1 sets out publicly, for the first time, key components of a three-year digital money work plan
						for the RBA and Treasury.</p>
					<p>Our most immediate priority is to launch the public phase of Project Acacia. Project Acacia aims to build
						on the lessons from our CBDC pilot last year by focussing on opportunities to uplift the efficiency,
						transparency and resilience of wholesale markets through tokenised money and new settlement
						infrastructure. Subsequent phases of the project may well involve cross-border applications with regional
						central banks. In October, the RBA, alongside our research partners at the Digital Finance Cooperative
						Research Centre, will publish a consultation paper inviting industry engagement.</p>
					<p>A second step is to launch industry and academic CBDC advisory forums in the first half of 2025, covering
						both retail and wholesale CBDC issues. We have benefited significantly from engagement with industry and
						the academic community on various CBDC issues over recent years, and we now seek to put more structure
						around this dialogue. These forums would play a similar role to those the RBA has convened in recent
						years with economists from industry and academia, to hear different views on monetary policy issues.</p>
					<p>A third initiative, to begin next year, builds on a lesson from last year’s CBDC pilot and will
						involve supporting reforms to a regulatory sandbox for financial innovation, including digital money and
						infrastructure. Industry feedback suggests the existing sandbox, which provides unlicensed businesses
						scope to test new financial products and services for a limited time, could be enhanced. Treasury will
						work with the Government to consider the recommendations of an independent review into the sandbox, and,
						where appropriate, implement reforms.</p>
					<p>A fourth initiative commencing later next year may involve a series of ‘deliberative workshops’
						on retail CBDC with the Australian community. Focus groups could include a broad cross-section of the
						population as well as minority groups that can be under-represented in public policy consultations.
						Recent international experience suggests that deliberative engagement of this sort can be a useful
						complement to the standard (consultation paper) approach.</p>
					<p>Finally, the RBA and Treasury are committed to reassessing the merits of a retail CBDC over time, with a
						follow up paper to be published in 2027. By this time we will have had an opportunity to reflect on
						feedback from community engagement and to conduct further research into the implications of competing
						design options. There should also be a richer vein of international experience to draw on.</p>

					<h2>Legal and Decision-making Considerations for CBDC in Australia</h2>
					<p>As a practical matter, any form of CBDC would be issued by the RBA. However, the introduction of a retail
						CBDC for use among the public would raise important political economy issues and give rise to significant
						changes to Australia’s financial arrangements. As such, the Australian Government would ultimately
						decide whether to introduce a retail CBDC. Enabling legislation would very likely be required, consistent
						with the international experience.</p>
					<p>In the case of wholesale CBDC, the legal, regulatory and primary decision-making implications would likely
						depend on the design and scope of its use. As a general guide, the more transformative the proposed
						arrangements vis-à-vis our current system of ES balances, the more likely it is that supporting
						legislative change (and active Government engagement) would be required.</p>
					<p>Bottom line, it would be safe to assume that the RBA, Treasury and Australian Government would closely
						consult ahead of any decision to issue a CBDC – retail or wholesale – should a public policy
						case emerge.</p>
					<p>A final point here is that the RBA and Treasury would view it as sub-optimal to compromise any CBDC design
						features in an effort to give it legal status under current legislative or regulatory frameworks.
						Instead, it would be preferable to identify the features of a CBDC that were most desirable from a policy
						perspective, and then make any necessary enabling amendments to applicable legislation.</p>
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>Let me sum up. At the present time, we assess the potential benefits as more promising, and the challenges
						less problematic, for wholesale CBDC compared to the retail variant.</p>
					<p>Australians are generally well served by a safe, efficient and innovative retail payments system. Given
						the potential benefits of a retail CBDC in Australia appear modest at the present time, and a retail CBDC
						would create non-trivial challenges for financial stability and monetary policy implementation, we are
						yet to see a strong public policy case emerge for issuing a retail CBDC. In jurisdictions that have
						issued a retail CBDC (exclusively lower income economies) or indicated that it is quite possible in
						coming years, the main motivations have less resonance in Australia. Nevertheless, as the retail payments
						landscape is rapidly evolving and the implications of a retail CBDC are still to be fully understood, we
						will continue to examine these issues, including as more international evidence comes to light.</p>
					<p>In the meantime, the role that a wholesale CBDC and other forms of digital money and infrastructure
						upgrades could play in enhancing the functioning of our wholesale markets will be the principal focus of
						our future work program. This reflects our assessment of the scope for new innovations that would
						preserve the benefits of our ‘two tier’ monetary system – though there are still plenty
						of issues that require careful consideration. Whatever the shape of future innovation in our financial
						system, it is reasonable to expect central bank money will continue to serve as the ultimate safe
						settlement asset, particularly in systemically important markets.</p>
					<p>The question of how we might arrange our monetary system to better support the Australian economy in the
						digital age is a strategic priority for the RBA. We look forward to engaging with your ideas on how this
						might best be achieved.</p>
